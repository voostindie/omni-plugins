# OmniFocus plugin: Focus

This plugin sets the focus in OmniFocus to a predefined set of folders and/or
projects.

OmniFocus's "focus" feature is useful, because it sets a global filter in the active window, across all perspectives, for as long as it's activated. It's also cumbersome to use, because setting the focus to one or more folders and/or projects is a manual process: make sure the sidebar shows all projects, then select one or more, then select Focus.

Hence this plugin. It has an action for every predefined group of folders and/or projects that I prefer to set the focus to. At the moment there's four of them:

1. Work
2. Off the clock
3. Volleyball
4. Personal

The order they are shown here match the keyboard shortcuts I set up for them: *Option + digit* selects the designated focus.

The actions work as a toggle: activating the same action twice disables the focus altogether.

A big shout out to [Sal Soghoian](https://omni-automation.com) for saving me a lot of time!
