# OmniFocus Focus plugin

This plugin sets the focus in OmniFocus to a predefined set of folders and/or
projects.

For every predefined set there's a separate action:

1. Work
2. Off the clock
3. Volleyball
4. Personal

The order they are shown here match the keyboard shortcuts I set up for them: *Option + digit** selects the designated focus. If that focus is already active, it is disabled.

A big shout out to [Sal Soghoian](https://omni-automation.com) for saving me a lot of time!
